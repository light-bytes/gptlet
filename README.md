# Features

```- Lightweight
- Stores an OpenAI API key to localStorage of the website gptlet was accessed from
- Stores a single chat history to localStorage of the website gptlet was accessed from
- Persists as long as Safari is open in the app switcher ( variably )
- Works on most if not all resolutions
- Theoeretically should work on any browser that supports bookmarklets and HTML / CSS / JS libraries past 2010
```

# installation iOS Mobile Safari

```
- Open Safari then create and save a new bookmark for any website
- Copy the contents of `gptlet.js` to your clipboard on device
- Go back into Safari bookmarks and 3d press the bookmark you saved
- Edit the bookmark and paste the contents of your clipboard
- Save the bookmark and run it on any SECURE website
```

# ⚠️ IMPORTANT

The bookmarklet should only be used from a secure website due to storing The OpenAI API key via a domain's localStorage and therefore exposing it to that domain and any code ran on that domain or other bookmarklets. Due to browser restrictions, localStorage is used on a per-domain basis. Meaning, should you use gptlet from https://google.com for instance. You could not access your chat hitory or API key from https://bing.com. 

# About the project

To simply put it I'm broke and rebellious.. Im a self taught programmer from childhood, having my roots in reverse-enginnering game servers. As a result, in the present, I have an older iPhone with an older iOS version and older WebKit version. This is because I want to have my iPhone jailbroken, it stays on 14.8.1 so that I can get the proper use out of it that any person should. However, anyone in the scene knows that apple forces older iOS versions to become obsolete. https://chat.openai.com stopped working for any browser on my phone due to apple enforcing iPhones to use WebKit. WebKit is unable to be updated for older iOS versions! What a coincidence for Apple, AI App developers have stopped targeting older iOS versions as well..

Anyways, I hope this returns some convenience and peace to your life! I will continue to push updates and im offering user support at https://t.me/gptlet.

Please, if this helped your life at all, and you feel like helping mine out, my eth/bnb address is `0xCb379f783aaD79d0fEc60414a8A3C712f762080B`
